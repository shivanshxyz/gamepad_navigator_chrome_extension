# Chrome Navigator

### Chrome Navigator is an open source project that allows you to browse chrome using your Xbox / PlayStation / other controllers!

###### NOTE: All the controls mentioned below are with respect to the Xbox One Controller.

## With your controller you have the following controls (with plenty more in the works!):
- RB/LB: Seeks forwards and backwards through history ( simulates pressing the back and forward arrows in the top left corner )
- RT/LT: Focuses the right / left tab respectively.
- Right Analog Stick: Uses the vertical axis to simulate scrolling up and down. Will also "sprint" ( increase scroll speed by a factor of 2 ) if you click the stick downwards while scrolling.
- Combination of Right & Left Analog Sticks: When pinching inwards or pulling outwards ( like you would on a smart phone ) the focused tab will zoom in and out.
- Select Button: Closes the current tab.
- Start Button: Opens a new tab default to the google search


## Controls to be added in the near future:
- Left Analog Stick: Ability to seek from one clickable item to another.
- A Button: Ability to click on the selected item.
- Hold Y While Moving Left Analog: Go specifically from one search bar to another.
- When a Text Box is Clicked: On screen keyboard that can be manipulated with your gamepad as well.
